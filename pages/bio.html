                        Artist, sound designer and programmer based in Valencia, Spain, Marco Ferreira is interested in exploring personal critical approaches to the new social and technological mechanisms of our society. In order to do this, his work is mainly focused in the reconstruction and interpretation of new gestures and human-world interactions. He achieves this by working with fundamental structures, recycling interaction gestures and by having a strong personal approach to his sound, visual and code experimentations.

                        The Portuguese artist had his first contact with the world of sound production and design in 2014, having completed a degree in Music Production and Technologies, in Porto. After finishing his internship in the performing arts field, he moved to Spain, where he began to create sound content for different types of media. His earlier engineering studies allowed him to combine sound and code, leading to the construction of the artist's most personal work and to experiment with the interaction design field. He recently finished a Masterâ€™s degree in Media Arts where he had the chance to expand his artistic expression through the development of several interactive projects. The result of this fusion materializes in the creation of installations, audiovisual interfaces and interdisciplinary performances, which bring together elements such as code, sound, light, video, body and space.
