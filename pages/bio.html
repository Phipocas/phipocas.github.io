                        Media artist, based in Valencia, Spain, Marco Ferreira presents an artistic collection that revolves around the mixture of new media with traditional forms of expression. He focuses a large part of his projects on the creation and adaptation of an artistic language that unites creative programming, sound, image, among others. </p>
                    <p>
                        The Portuguese artist had his first contact with the world of sound production and design in 2014, having completed a degree in Music Production and Technologies, in Porto. Once he finished his studies, he did his internship as a sound technician, where he had the opportunity to delve into the social and artistic context of the performing arts. In this way, and a year later, he moved to Spain, where he began to create sound content for theater and video game companies. He has worked with various theater artists, especially Valencian and Catalan. He was also able to direct his musical focus to the area of ​​videogames, working as a composer, sound designer and audio programmer for emerging companies in Valencia.

His sound works are joined by his interest in programming and new media. Having completed a Master's Degree in Electronic Engineering from the Porto Engineering Faculty in 2011, his knowledge of programming has allowed him to combine these two branches, leading to the construction of the artist's most personal work. Apart from this, he has studied other courses in the area of ​​artificial intelligence and "deep learning". The result of this fusion materializes in the creation of installations and audiovisual interfaces and interdisciplinary performances, which unite elements such as code, sound, light, video, body and space.

He is, at this moment, studying a Master in Visual Arts and Multimedia, at the Faculty of Fine Arts, in Valencia, where he will continue to develop his interest in all these disciplines.
