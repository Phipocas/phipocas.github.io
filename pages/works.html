                                    In the face of the uncontrollable flow that drags us in our day-to-day lives in a world guided by the digital culture of speed, the possibility of dance arises as an exploration of alternatives to this prevailing order. The body, through dance, is established as a physical element that complements and opposes the virtual, proposing, through its imperfection, a subversion of measurement and the sequential order of events. This proposal seeks to explore error as a trigger for new possibilities of action, branching paths that leave behind linearity to develop in a more rhizomatic environment.                                
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    The research establishes a connection between dance and new media by employing them as mechanisms for transforming space and, to some extent, the reality that is made possible and perceived. In symbiosis with the body, audiovisual production creates a variable and interactive spatiotemporal framework. The development of a proposal is proposed that gives protagonism to the body as a catalyst for action, working around repetition and the variables that can be introduced to unleash a succession of events that breaks with the ordered and closed narrative sequence. Interactive audiovisual elements are linked to gesture, inhabiting time and carrying out a resignification of both time and space.

                                    After presenting the performative version of the piece in Ruzafa, Valencia, I decided to turn my attention to its origin through an installation format.

                                    Timecode is an hybrid experience that explores our interaction with the new intelligent systems available to us daily, with the aim of exposing the changes that these produce in the temporal perception of our experience.

                                    The logistics of modern society pressure us to believe that there is a way to deal with time. That time is money. Therefore, it generates an initial problem, for which only its system has the solution. In this way, step by step, it makes human dependence on its organisms, institutions and devices grow. The construction of tools is not followed by a conscious social and emotional education, causing the technology that we have at our disposal to become, many times, a barrier to our own development. It takes more and more space, not only in the production processes, but also in those of creation, diluting the separation between our time and the experimentation processes. What do we save when we choose not to participate in a production process? What kind of consequences do these shortcuts carry outside of the current social perception of time? What problems can this create within the context of artistic diversity and authenticity?

                                    This project is born from the need to stop this chain of thought, to prioritize individual processes and the construction of the individual in a society ruled by stress. The installation addresses, initially, the perception of individual time and, secondly, with a performance extension, the domestication of humans by their production and creation systems.

                                    Communities are created without any pretense of truth until they become what we know as city, which, loaded with symbols and confluences, generates and regenerates itself, over and over again, exhausting its own resources and its own energy.                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    The city is, therefore, located between the human and the symbol. The city is shown as the ultimate expansion of life, of manipulated matter and of the artifice of the real. His crazy relationship with nature is exposed, which ends up becoming a straight and coagulated nature. In the city we move away from ourselves to become images of desire, matter that gives way to plastic, to the artificial. But a city has no pretensions if it is not inhabited, a city exists with and for life and survival. For the community.

                                    In consequence of its normalization, the digital has become noticeable through its absence. Our devices are now an extension of our body, just like our hands and feet.

                                    The way we create and express ourselves is more and more connected to our digital tools, increasing our production possibilities but limiting our knowledge about the creation process.

                                    “When hunger scratches me inside, he himself feeds me. He tells my story. The story of how I stopped having a master to be the fucking master."

                                    Lázaro is a free adaptation of the Spanish classic El Lazarillo de Tormes. It is the same universal story that we all know. Almost. Lázaro is changing masters, but the masters of the 21st century are not the same as those of the 16th. An old drunk known as "el ciego", the Moor, the secret, violence and drugs in the streets are the masters of Lázaro. Music and friends, condensed in the character of Marco, the musician on stage, finally allow Lázaro to become his own master.

                                <p>Being a closed vertical transportation system, an elevator confines one or more people in a journey between different spaces. It is, for this reason, a bridge, or even the very element of wiring in which its information packets navigate - the humans inside. The idea of ​​going up or down is transmitted, almost entirely, by the sensation of gravity provided by the movement of the elevator, the only one we have until the opening and entry into the new world.

                                    The installation consists on the aquisition of data from the elevator for the creation of the soundscape, which depends on the passenger condition and choices.
